Some notes:
1. The reference file was static and should have contained just the DNS 
   prefix value and the service name.  I've also added the 
   certificate ID for the next part.

2. I needed to pass the current LB dns name (which could have changed) 
   and the service name.

3. aState reads static file, get's DNS prefix from it.

4. Finds match in file to command line param and compares LB dns name 
   param to current value in R53.  If different, updates.

Now, for the new part, only if we update, we also need to:

Fix the load balancer in two ways:

1. Add SSL Certificate to Listener entry (on port 443).  
   Certificate ID is in static file.

2. Update listener protocol from TCP to HTTPS.

If you want a crack at that, go for it, otherwise I'll do it tonight.  
I tweaked my back, so I need to go lay down for a bit.
